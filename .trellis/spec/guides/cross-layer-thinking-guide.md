# Cross-Layer Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Think through data flow across layers before implementing.

---

## The Problem

**Most bugs happen at layer boundaries**, not within layers.

Common cross-layer bugs:

- API returns format A, frontend expects format B
- Database stores X, service transforms to Y, but loses data
- Multiple layers implement the same logic differently

---

## Before Implementing Cross-Layer Features

### Step 1: Map the Data Flow

Draw out how data moves:

```
Source → Transform → Store → Retrieve → Transform → Display
```

For each arrow, ask:

- What format is the data in?
- What could go wrong?
- Who is responsible for validation?

### Step 2: Identify Boundaries

| Boundary              | Common Issues                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| API ↔ Service         | Type mismatches, missing fields   |
| Service ↔ Database    | Format conversions, null handling |
| Backend ↔ Frontend    | Serialization, date formats       |
| Component ↔ Component | Props shape changes               |

### Step 3: Define Contracts

For each boundary:

- What is the exact input format?
- What is the exact output format?
- What errors can occur?

---

## Common Cross-Layer Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Implicit Format Assumptions

**Bad**: Assuming date format without checking

**Good**: Explicit format conversion at boundaries

### Mistake 2: Scattered Validation

**Bad**: Validating the same thing in multiple layers

**Good**: Validate once at the entry point

### Mistake 3: Leaky Abstractions

**Bad**: Component knows about database schema

**Good**: Each layer only knows its neighbors

### Mistake 4: Every Consumer Parses The Same Payload

**Bad**: A command reads JSONL events and casts fields inline:

```typescript
const thread = (ev as { thread?: string }).thread;
const labels = (ev as { labels?: string[] }).labels;
```

This looks local, but it means every consumer owns a private version of the
event contract. The next field change will update one command and miss another.

**Good**: Decode once at the event boundary, then export typed projections:

```typescript
if (!isThreadEvent(ev)) return false;
return ev.thread === filter.thread;
```

**Rule**: For append-only logs, JSON streams, RPC payloads, or config files,
create one owner for:

- event / payload type definitions
- type guards and normalization from `unknown`
- metadata projections used by UI commands
- reducers that replay state from the source of truth

Rendering code may format fields, but it must not redefine the payload contract.

## Checklist for Cross-Layer Features

Before implementation:

- [ ] Mapped the complete data flow
- [ ] Identified all layer boundaries
- [ ] Defined format at each boundary
- [ ] Decided where validation happens

After implementation:

- [ ] Tested with edge cases (null, empty, invalid)
- [ ] Verified error handling at each boundary
- [ ] Checked data survives round-trip
- [ ] Checked that consumers import shared decoders / projections instead of
      casting payload fields locally
- [ ] Checked that derived state points back to the source event identifier
      (`seq`, `id`, `version`) instead of inventing a second cursor

## Deployment Health vs Data-Path Health

When a release changes an ORM model, migration, queue payload, or other durable
contract, a generic process health endpoint is not enough:

- [ ] Identify how an already-deployed durable store reaches the new contract;
      table creation helpers commonly do not alter existing tables.
- [ ] Verify the exact production revision and runtime contract before applying
      a migration.
- [ ] Add a post-deploy probe that crosses the changed boundary, such as a real
      current-ORM query; do not infer data-path health from a static endpoint.
- [ ] Distinguish repository state, running process state, and physical storage
      state. Evidence for one does not prove the other two.
- [ ] Keep destructive repair separate from ordinary deployment, with explicit
      authorization, backup, preconditions, and failure-state handling.

Project-specific FableSpace migration and repair contracts live in
[`../backend/database-guidelines.md`](../backend/database-guidelines.md).

## Deployment Environment Rewrite Boundary

An ignored production `.env` is still a cross-layer contract when deployment
tooling rewrites it. Runtime parsing can be correct locally while the deployed
container is broken because a reconciler removed, renamed, or failed to pass a
referenced variable.

Before changing a deployment-level config source:

- [ ] Trace `developer env → server reconciler → Docker env_file/environment →
      runtime settings`; do not stop at the runtime parser.
- [ ] Search every retirement/removal list for both the pointer variable and
      the server-side variable it references.
- [ ] Verify ignored real env files have an explicit migration or recovery
      path; updating `.env.example` does not migrate a server.
- [ ] Ensure recovery reads only a narrowly owned backup location and never
      logs secret values or full env contents.
- [ ] Make the deploy output expose a fixed, non-sensitive readiness state and
      fail before container replacement when an explicitly configured pointer
      cannot resolve.
- [ ] Validate the provider before container replacement with fixed non-user
      text. Config-object construction, generic process health, and a successful
      image build do not prove that credentials, model, endpoint, and production
      network work together.
- [ ] Preserve safe failure categories across the provider adapter boundary.
      Catch-all fallback loops must retain HTTP status or network/response class
      without logging URLs, credentials, prompts, or response bodies.
- [ ] Scope alternate egress to the adapter that needs it. A process-wide
      `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` can silently reroute authentication, storage,
      health, and other integrations; verify non-target traffic stays direct.

**FableSpace example**: StoryWorld runtime correctly reused
`FABLEMAP_DEFAULT_FREE_LLM_API_KEY_ENV=OPENCODE_API_KEY`, but the server
reconciler still classified `OPENCODE_API_KEY` as retired and removed it from
the exact `apps/api/.env` passed to Docker. Local provider probes and process
health both passed while production dialogue remained unavailable.

**Follow-up failure**: production and a forced-direct local probe returned the
same provider HTTP 500/404 pattern with the same Key, while an earlier local
probe through the system proxy succeeded. Key equality and server geography do
not prove route equivalence: validate the exact provider contract from the
production egress path before replacement, and distinguish provider HTTP
failure from DNS/TCP/TLS failure without exposing the endpoint or credential.

## Generated Speech and Narration Boundary

When one model response feeds both a chat transcript and story presentation,
do not infer presentation type from the caller (“Character model”). Make the
semantic boundary structural and trace it through prompt, parser, policy,
persistence, context construction, API projection, and UI styling.

- [ ] Give spoken dialogue and observable narration separate typed fields.
- [ ] Persist only actual spoken words as `role=character`; render narration as
      a system presentation without Character avatar or speaker label.
- [ ] Exclude presentation narration from later Character speech context.
- [ ] Reject mixed output at the policy boundary and use a pure-dialogue safe
      replacement; prompt instructions alone are not validation.
- [ ] Handle legacy mixed records through a narrow read-time projection when
      possible; do not rewrite history or fabricate missing dialogue.
- [ ] Test the provider probe against the same structured contract required by
      runtime, not merely a non-empty response.

See [`../backend/historical-choice-chat.md`](../backend/historical-choice-chat.md)
for the executable response and persistence contract.

## Cross-Platform Template Consistency

In Trellis, command templates (e.g., `record-session.md`) exist in **multiple platforms** with identical or near-identical content. This is a cross-layer boundary.

### Checklist: After Modifying Any Command Template

- [ ] Find all platforms with the same command: `find src/templates/*/commands/trellis/ -name "<command>.*"`
- [ ] Update all platform copies (Markdown `.md` and TOML `.toml`)
- [ ] For Gemini TOML: adapt line continuations (`\\` vs `\`) and triple-quoted strings
- [ ] Run `/trellis:check-cross-layer` to verify nothing was missed

**Real-world example**: Updated `record-session.md` in Claude to use `--mode record`, but forgot iFlow, Kilo, OpenCode, and Gemini — caught by cross-layer check.

---

## Generated Runtime Template Upgrade Consistency

Some generated files are both documentation and runtime input. In Trellis,
`.trellis/workflow.md` is parsed by `get_context.py`, `workflow_phase.py`,
SessionStart filters, and per-turn hooks. Template changes must be validated
against both fresh init and upgrade paths.

### Checklist: After Modifying A Runtime-Parsed Template

- [ ] Identify every runtime parser that reads the template, not just the file
      writer that installs it
- [ ] Check whether relevant syntax lives outside obvious managed regions
      such as tag blocks
- [ ] Verify fresh `init` output and a versioned `update` scenario that writes
      the older `.trellis/.version`
- [ ] Add an upgrade regression using an older pristine template fixture, then
      assert the installed file reaches the current packaged shape
- [ ] Update the backend spec that owns the runtime contract

---

## Versioned Documentation Boundary

Versioned documentation is a cross-layer boundary: source paths, `docs.json`
version routing, and the rendered version selector must all describe the same
release line.

### Checklist: Before Editing Versioned Docs

- [ ] Identify the target release line: stable, beta, or RC
- [ ] Verify the edited MDX path matches that line:
  - stable: `docs-site/{start,advanced,...}` and `docs-site/zh/{start,advanced,...}`
  - beta: `docs-site/beta/**` and `docs-site/zh/beta/**`
  - RC: `docs-site/rc/**` and `docs-site/zh/rc/**`
- [ ] Verify `docs.json` navigation points the version label to the same paths
- [ ] Grep the opposite tree for release-line-specific terms before committing
- [ ] Treat beta content appearing under root release paths as a source-path bug,
      not a rendering bug

**Real-world example**: A beta-only task workflow change documented
`prd.md` + `design.md` + `implement.md`, task-creation consent, and Codex
mode banners under root `start/` and `advanced/` paths. The docs site then
served 0.6 beta behavior under the Release selector. The fix was to restore root
release docs, move the 0.6 content to `beta/` and `zh/beta/`, and add a grep
audit for beta markers against the root release tree.

**Real-world example**: Codex inline mode changed workflow platform markers from
`[Codex]` / `[Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]` to `[codex-sub-agent]` /
`[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]`. Fresh init was correct, but
`trellis update` only merged `[workflow-state:*]` blocks and preserved stale
markers outside those blocks. Result: upgraded projects got new hook scripts
but old workflow routing, so `get_context.py --mode phase --platform codex`
could return empty Phase 2.1 detail.

## Mode-Detection Probe Checklist

When a CLI auto-detects a mode by probing a remote resource (e.g., checking if `index.json` exists to decide marketplace vs direct download):

### Before implementing:

- [ ] Probe runs in **ALL** code paths that use the result (interactive, `-y`, `--flag` combos)
- [ ] 404 vs transient error are distinguished — don't treat both as "not found"
- [ ] Transient errors **abort or retry**, never silently switch modes
- [ ] Shared state (caches, prefetched data) is **reset** when context changes (e.g., user switches source)
- [ ] **Shortcut paths** (e.g., `--template` skipping picker) must have the same error-handling quality as the probed path — check that downstream functions don't call catch-all wrappers

### After implementing:

- [ ] Trace every path from probe result to the mode-decision branch — no fallthrough
- [ ] External format contracts (giget URI, raw URLs) are tested or at least documented as comments
- [ ] Metadata reads consume a complete response or use a streaming parser — never parse a fixed-size prefix as full JSON
- [ ] When reconstructing a composite identifier from parsed parts, verify **all** fields are included and in the **correct position** (e.g., `provider:repo/path#ref` not `provider:repo#ref/path`)
- [ ] Verify that **action functions** called after a shortcut don't internally use the old catch-all fetch — they must use the probe-quality variant when error distinction matters

**Real-world example**: Custom registry flow had 8 bugs across 3 review rounds: (1) probe only ran in interactive mode, (2) transient errors fell through to wrong mode, (3) giget URI had `#ref` in wrong position, (4) prefetched templates leaked across source switches, (5) `--template` shortcut bypassed probe but `downloadTemplateById` internally used catch-all `fetchTemplateIndex`, turning timeouts into "Template not found".

**Real-world example**: Agent-session update hints fetched npm `latest` metadata with `response.read(4096)` and then parsed it as complete JSON. The `@mindfoldhq/trellis` package metadata exceeded 4 KB, so the JSON was truncated, parse failed silently, and the first session injection showed no update hint. Fix: read the complete response before parsing, and add a regression where `version` is followed by an 8 KB metadata tail.

## Cross-Platform Template Consistency

In Trellis, command templates (e.g., `record-session.md`) exist in **multiple platforms** with identical or near-identical content. This is a cross-layer boundary.

### Checklist: After Modifying Any Command Template

- [ ] Find all platforms with the same command: `find src/templates/*/commands/trellis/ -name "<command>.*"`
- [ ] Update all platform copies (Markdown `.md` and TOML `.toml`)
- [ ] For Gemini TOML: adapt line continuations (`\\` vs `\`) and triple-quoted strings
- [ ] Run `/trellis:check-cross-layer` to verify nothing was missed

**Real-world example**: Updated `record-session.md` in Claude to use `--mode record`, but forgot iFlow, Kilo, OpenCode, and Gemini — caught by cross-layer check.

## When to Create Flow Documentation

Create detailed flow docs when:

- Feature spans 3+ layers
- Multiple teams are involved
- Data format is complex
- Feature has caused bugs before

---

## Event Log / Projection Boundary

Append-only logs are cross-layer contracts. A single event travels through:

```
CLI input → event writer → events.jsonl → reader → filter → reducer → display
```

### Checklist: After Adding A New Event Kind Or Field

- [ ] Add the event kind to the central event taxonomy
- [ ] Add a typed event variant or type guard at the event layer
- [ ] Add normalization helpers for array/object fields that come from
      user input or JSON
- [ ] Keep `seq` / `id` assignment in the event writer only
- [ ] Make filters and reducers consume the typed event guard, not local casts
- [ ] Make display code consume reducer output or typed events, not raw JSON
- [ ] Add at least one regression that proves history replay and live filtering
      use the same filter model

**Real-world example**: Thread channels added `kind: "thread"`, `description`,
`context`, labels, and `lastSeq`. The first implementation replayed thread
state correctly, but several commands still re-parsed event payload fields with
local casts. The fix was to make the core event layer own `ThreadChannelEvent`
and `isThreadEvent`, make `reduceChannelMetadata` the only channel metadata
projection, and make `reduceThreads` the only thread replay reducer.
